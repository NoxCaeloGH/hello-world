# hello-world

I am currently trying to learn how to use GitHub.

It has some pretty useful features that allow multiple people to work on the same project.
GitHub reminds me of a feature of Eclipse in that way... 

I plan on using GitHub to explore and learn more about coding...
  Adding to open source projects
  Adding my own projects
  
 I don't like pineapple on pizzas but I don't think it's terrible either.
